### 1. **Explanation of Mathematical Expression**

The code implements a **2D Convolution** operation. The formula for a 2D convolution operation can be expressed as:

\[
y(x, y) = \sum_{i=-n}^{n} \sum_{j=-n}^{n} x(x + i, y + j) \cdot k(n + j, n + j)
\]

Where:
- \( y(x, y) \) is the output value at position \( (x, y) \).
- \( x(x + i, y + j) \) is the value of the input matrix at position \( (x + i, y + j) \).
- \( k(n + j, n + j) \) is the value of the kernel at position \( (n + j, n + j) \).
- The indices \( i, j \) iterate over the kernel dimensions, ranging from \( -n \) to \( n \), where \( n \) is half the size of the kernel minus 1.

The kernel performs convolution by sliding over the input matrix and computing the weighted sum of the neighboring pixels.

### 2. **Comparison Between Math Formulas and Code**

Let's compare the mathematical formulas with the corresponding code implementation. The 2D convolution is implemented inside the `Conv2D` kernel.

### 3. **Explanation of Important Formulas**

#### Convolution Sum:

The main mathematical operation for convolution is:

\[
y(x, y) = \sum_{i=-n}^{n} \sum_{j=-n}^{n} x(x + i, y + j) \cdot k(n + j, n + j)
\]

This expression calculates the output at position \( (x, y) \) by taking the weighted sum of the neighboring values in the input matrix, where the weights come from the kernel. The kernel "slides" over the input matrix, and at each position, a weighted sum of pixels is computed.

#### Kernel Indices:

The kernel is typically a square matrix with dimensions \( (2n + 1) \times (2n + 1) \). The kernel is indexed from \( -n \) to \( n \), and this can be transformed into a 1D array for easier access. The expression used in the code is:

\[
\text{kernel}[(2 * n + 1) * (n + j) + n + j]
\]

Here:
- \( (2 * n + 1) \) is the total number of elements in a row of the kernel.
- The index \( (n + j) \) shifts the kernel to the center, as the kernel is symmetric.
- The formula maps the 2D kernel indices to the 1D array.

#### Boundary Handling:

To ensure the convolution operation works only within valid regions of the input matrix, the code checks whether the current pixel in the input matrix is within bounds:

```cpp
if(0 <= x + i && x + i < k && 0 <= y + j && y + j < k)
```

This condition ensures that the convolution is only performed when the indices \( (x + i, y + j) \) are within the bounds of the input matrix. If any part of the kernel would go out of bounds, it is ignored.

---

In summary:
- The code performs a 2D convolution using a kernel of size \( 2n + 1 \).
- Each thread computes the weighted sum for a single output pixel.
- Boundary conditions are handled by checking the input indices to avoid accessing out-of-bounds memory.
