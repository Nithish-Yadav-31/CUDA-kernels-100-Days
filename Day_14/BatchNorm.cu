  // 5. Define Grid and Block Dimensions

  //  * Adjust block sizes to your compute capability to tune/optimize at scale. This also depends on your device's processing speeds from RAM & Global
  // For batch normalization we are bound mostly due to ram transfers speed and bandwidth bottlenecks than cpu instruction executions, to achieve a realistic
  // test it will need to do benchmarks per instruction types for cuda intrinsics being called against gpu core throughput capacity in gigaflops to
  //  decide a practical tradeoff that fits into a useful range instead of "guessing and checking random numbers that are good enough.
  // Batch Norm typically sees improvement mostly when its memory optimization against larger datasets that doesnt get stuck loading everything at start vs a more constant throughput.
  //  In this simplified scenario the optimal balance to a fixed problem would typically involve finding a sweet spot between register and thread usage versus coalesced data acesses against memory transactions
  // by ensuring your instructions & global device sizes being allocated are suitable or it risks starving for more threads/SM that could fill them.
  // To simulate a realistic operation for CUDA C kernels, aim to do multiple layers in your neural network such as concat->matmul->meanvariance at much
  // more dimensions instead, or at the very very least call other layers such as Conv layers to take place right after Batchnorm to maintain thread occupancy & sm usage.

  int threadsPerBlock = 256;  //For tuning params here just pick powers of 2 until CUDA kernel dies from instruction overflows and dial down.

  //This requires proper evaluation with SM resource usage and what best parameters. Its important to scale depending on gpu model number because its limited hardware
