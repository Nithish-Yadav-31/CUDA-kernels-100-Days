### Matrix Multiplication CUDA Program Explanation:

1. **Matrix Initialization**:
   - Matrices `A`, `B`, and `C` are initialized on the host. 
   - `A[i][j]` is initialized to `i + j`, and `B[i][j]` is initialized to `i * j`. You can modify these initialization patterns as needed.

2. **CUDA Kernel (`MatrixMul`)**:
   - This kernel performs matrix multiplication. Each thread computes one element of the result matrix `C`.
   - For matrix multiplication, the element `C[i][j]` is the dot product of the `i`-th row of matrix `A` and the `j`-th column of matrix `B`.

3. **Grid and Block Dimensions**:
   - We define the block size to be `16x16` (i.e., 256 threads per block). This is a common choice for matrix operations.
   - `gridDim` is calculated based on the matrix size `N` and the block size. This ensures enough blocks are launched to cover the entire matrix.

4. **Memory Allocation**:
   - Memory is allocated for matrices on both the host and device using `malloc` and `cudaMalloc`.
   - The data is copied from the host matrices (`A` and `B`) to the device using `cudaMemcpy`.

5. **Matrix Multiplication Calculation**:
   - The kernel computes the value of each element of matrix `C` using the formula:
     \[
     C[i][j] = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} A[i][k] \times B[k][j]
     \]
     Each thread computes one element of `C` based on the corresponding row of `A` and column of `B`.

6. **Copying Results**:
   - After the kernel finishes, the resulting matrix `C` is copied back from the device to the host using `cudaMemcpy`.

7. **Printing the Result**:
   - The result matrix `C` is printed out to the console
